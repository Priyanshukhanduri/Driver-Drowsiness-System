## Introduction

This project is a Driver Drowsiness Detection System implemented on a Raspberry Pi. It uses computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's eye movements and issue an alert if signs of drowsiness or distraction are detected. The project aims to enhance road safety by preventing accidents caused by drowsy driving.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (with camera module)
- Speaker or buzzer for alerts

## Software Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- dlib (for facial landmarks)


## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-drowsiness-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python dlib (and any other libraries)
   ```

3. Connect the hardware components following the wiring diagram (if available).

4. (Include any other setup instructions here)

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script:

   ```
   python driver_drowsiness.py
   ```

2. (Explain any command-line arguments or configurations here)

## Algorithm

(Provide a brief explanation of the algorithm or techniques used in your project. Explain how the drowsiness detection works.)

## Demo

(Include a link to a video or GIF demonstrating your project in action, if available)
